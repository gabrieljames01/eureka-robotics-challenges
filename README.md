# eureka-robotics-challenges
Solutions to problems for internship application
created by Gabriel James Goenawan

## Challenges Solution on this repository:
Exercise 1) "Solving a 2D motion planning problem by PRM" at the page:
http://www.osrobotics.org/osr/planning/path_planning.html

Exercise 2) "Post-processing a 2D path" at the page:
https://osrobotics.org/osr/planning/post_processing.html

For each solution, I provided a `.py` and `.ipynb` file for better readability. However in my installation of python (Ubuntu 20.04), I was having trouble with PyLab plotting outside Jupyter Notebook, hence the plotting functionality on the `.py` fils is disabled.

For further question, please email me at GABR0022@e.ntu.edu.sg.
